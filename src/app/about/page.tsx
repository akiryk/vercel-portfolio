      <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
      <p>
        Since 2018, I’ve been the primary front-end engineer on two teams at
        Wayfair, Favorites and Registry, where I’ve created solutions to
        critical business needs using technologies including JavaScript, HTML,
        CSS, SCSS, React, Redux, Git, webpack, PHP, and node.
      </p>
      <p>
        From 2011 to 2017, I worked at NPR, where I combined the roles of
        front-end developer and visual designer, and created a variety of
        websites and online tools for member stations.
      </p>
      <h3>UX + UI Design</h3>
      <p>
        I studied interaction design at the California College of the Arts in
        San Francisco, and have led numerous user experience, user interface,
        and visual design projects while at NPR, Arnold Worldwide, and previous
        employers.
      </p>{" "}
      <h3>Communication</h3>
      <p>
        I’m a strong writer and public speaker; I’m comfortable explaining my
        work to clients and stakeholders; and I’m experienced collaborating with
        colleagues to discuss challenges, resolve conflicts, and work out
        solutions.
